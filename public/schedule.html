                    <h2>Gong Bath or Gong Meditation</h2>
                    <p>A gong meditation or gong bath  is an invitation to go to an internal state of silence, peace and truth. It allows for a complete relaxation with the sound, balances emotions and our bio-rhythm. It reduces stress and tension, harmonizing us on our natural frequency. It gives us the possibility to work through and advance personal topics. It regenerates, strengthens and brings us into balance.</p>
                    <p>How do i prepare for a gong session?</p>
                    <p>Come as you are, in a conscious, sober state, with comfortable clothes, eventually with an intention or a personal topic you’d like to work on. In the gong session you will lie down on a yoga mat, you can close your eyes and listen to the sound going into deep relaxation. You will notice the sound vibrations in your body, in case you feel tense, just breathe deeply and release. After the session, take your time to memorize how the deep relaxation feels so you can remember it whenever you feel like.</p>

                    <h2>Laughing Yoga + Meditation</h2>
                    <p>The aim of the class is to encourage a sense of playfulness. Laughter is as important to our well-being as breathing, eating, and sleeping, yet few people consciously put an effort to invite laughter into their lives. Laughter yoga (Hasyayoga) is a practice involving prolonged voluntary laughter. Laughter yoga is based on the belief that voluntary laughter provides the same physiological and psychological benefits as spontaneous laughter. Laughter yoga is done in groups, with eye contact, jokes and playfulness between participants. Forced laughter soon turns into real and contagious laughter. The session will be followed by a relaxing meditation. You don´t need any previous experience in yoga or meditation. Come with an open mind and experience the lightness of your being.</p>
                    <p>About Sri: I am a business school graduate, an ex-tech consultant and a meditation evangelist. Having spent a long time in the corporate world chasing money, building a posh career,  teaching colleagues meditation, I have finally come to consensus with life that I could do a lot more to those aroud me, a place where I can help people heal, connect with their inner beings, uplift human spirit. Not a single day has passed by without my craving to enthuse people around me with the lightness of my being. A birth blind man wouldn´t know what colours are, in the same way many humans are unaware of the unconsciousness that they are trapped in. Meditation is a tool to come out of this madness, wake up my friends, Arise, Awake and stop not until the goal is reached.</p>

                    <h2>Yin Yoga</h2>
                    <p>YIN and YANG come from Chinese and symbolize the feminine and the masculine. In Sanskrit YANG und YIN are called HA and THA. HA stands for the male, the sun, taking action while THA symbolizes the female, the moon, accepting. YIN yoga helps us to find a balance in the rushed reality we live in. There is so much YANG out there. Let’s get us some YIN. YIN yoga is all about letting go and allowing the present moment. In the end it is nothing but meditation. Through relaxing into the asanas for an extended period of time with a free flowing breath, you stretch the fascia muscles connective tissue and thereby release deeply hidden tensions in your body - physical as well as psychological tensions.</p>
                    <p>About the teacher: Nora is an avid meditator and yogini. She encountered yoga a few years ago during her studies of Economics when she was looking for a method to calm her mind and relax tensions in her body. When working as a consultant after her studies, yoga helped her to counteract the mind driven and stressful daily life. Going deeper into the yoga practice the wish grew within her to teach yoga in order to also help other people to overcome mental and physical ailments. At Green Yoga she teaches Yin Yoga and Hatha. The focus in her classes is mostly enhancing body awareness, as focusing on your inner energy field does not only bring you into the here and now but also unify your body, mind and soul.</p>
